        <p>Spaghetti is prepared by boiling pasta in salted water until soft, then draining it. A sauce 
            is made by frying onions and garlic in oil, adding tomatoes and spices, and cooking until 
            thick and flavorful. The cooked spaghetti is mixed with the sauce and served hot, with meat 
            or vegetables added if desired.</p>
